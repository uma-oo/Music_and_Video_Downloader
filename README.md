# Music and Video Downloader
### This Project is a result of continuous learning about how to implement object oriented code and also tkinter to create an amazing application which has the ability to download videos and Music and also playlists of videos or Music From YouTube by just hitting the link from YouTube
### The project has also the feature to download Playlists of videos or songs which are created on YouTube by providing only the link of the Playlist and choosing the format of the output from music or videos
# Installation and how to use:
Tkinter is included in all standard Python Distributions so you have just to use it without the pip install stuff.
The requirements.txt is also provided with code, but you have to install pytube Only (requirements.txt in my repository is generated by the pip command :
```Python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
So you may not need all the packages provided there !

Once everything is set up correctly you have to run the **main_user_interface.py** file .
# Features
### The user interface is designed to contain buttons to choose between whatever you want to download as the image below shows :

### After hitting the button of your choice , you see the interface below which asks you to enter the link which has to be submitted for now to not encounter an error and you hit the choose directory button to open the filedialog and customize your choice :
